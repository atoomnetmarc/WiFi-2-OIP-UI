# Contributing

Hi! Thanks for your interest in my personal hobby project. I love tinkering on it in my free time, but I have zero interest in becoming a project manager.

## Quick Note on Responses
Pull requests and non-bug issues will be closed without notice – quickest and least effort, not malicious (no PM ambitions!).

## No Pull Requests or Contributions
I do not accept them to keep full control. If something inspires me, I'll implement it myself.

## Exception: Personal Connections
If you know me in real life and can reach out directly, you're very welcome! Collaboration, contributions, or even spending a whole evening discussing the project creates real synergy.

## Issues
- **Bugs**: Very welcome! Let's fix them.
- **Feature ideas**: Appreciated, but I decide what (if anything) gets added.
- No general questions or support.

Thanks for understanding! Star the repo if you like it, or fork and build your own – you're awesome!
